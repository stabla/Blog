## Why I am starting a blog?

Nowadays, create a blog and posting articles on a blog seems to be a strange things, with [Medium](https://www.medium.com) giving you designed pages and an audience more easily than ever before or with [SteemIt](https://steemit.com/) where you can be paid to write, starting a blog by his own is something decadent.

But I am starting this blog specially for one reason: Because I want to have a documentation. I want to document things I learn, things that my future me will thank me to have write this.

#### For Code 
The goal is to have a support where I can check if I had a programming similar problem, if I resolved it, if I explained it. 
If I don't understand something, writing an article about it could be a way to improve myself, to understand it, and share what I didn't understand. And why.

Why not to share my walkthrough, and see my progress on new things.
Why not to share about web technologies as AngularJS5, React, Vue.js? Or programming languages as Java, Python or even Go if I learn it someday? And what if I learn a trick on algorithm? I will create an article and post it. That's how it works.

#### For Technicals things
Linux, Systems, a doc for regex, Databases, Distributed Systems, or important things to understand, or get how blockchain technologies is built? And why not... maybe one day build my own... okay I'm going really far but **dreaming is important** :)

#### For Design
Learning new things on Framer.js, InVision, Origami, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, SKetch, Mockups? I will share it.

#### For What I learn?
And what about share what I learned and what I want to remember? The blog is a way to save it and find it when I need. It's a way to share it as well, or just to try to explain it. It's crazy how many things you think you know but you're not capable to explain it clearly, because humans are not used to explain it, it's not natural, therefore we have to learn to explain things to others. 

#### For Whatever I want. 
Yes, because this is my place, my area, so if I want to talk about 

#### But why not Medium?
I have already posted few articles on Medium.com, just for fun, I didn't wait audience, I didn't do that for likes, I just wanted to write something and try to explain something. But on Medium.com, there's a lot of people, and high quality content. Here, I can just write whatever I want, no need to have followers or anaything like that. There's no "follow button" or competition.

Here, I'm alone, I'm with me. And it's the most important.

But if you want to push a comment, a critic, feel free, I'm really open to discussion.
