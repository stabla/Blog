## Me, myself, I... and my smartphone

Too much! It's too much, too much emails, too much tweets, too much content. Too much information. There is everything, everywhere, and I feel like I'm always missing something. For this reasons, I'm checking my phone more than twice per hour, and honestly, it's too much.

I'm checking things I had already checked previously, just to be sure I'm not missing something, but you know what? I'm not missing anything. 

#### Problem
This smartphone is decomposing my capacity to focus, even if I want to work few hours on a project, without being distracted, I'm finishing to take my phone. When I need to think a moment on what I'm doing, I'm taking the easy way and the distraction : opening Twitter, Reddit, checking mails, looking for new Message, nothing. Still nothing, but it took me away from my reflection. Ok, so, I need to change this **bad habit**. 

#### Solution
Drastic solution would be to leave the smartphone far away from me. But it's not the best, why? Because when I would have access again to the phone, I would have kept the bad habit and what I want here is to destroy it. I want to have phone like a tool, and not like a distraction. To change my routine, I will do it progressively. First step, push all "useless" app in the same folder, and disable notification and badges. 

The only app authorized: Messages, Phone, and GPS.
Allowing me everything else during evening: 3h/day for 3 days, 2h/day for 2 days, and 1h/day the rest. This challenge will last 2 weeks.

##### First part (3 days):
We'll see !

#### Conclusion
Come-back later !
